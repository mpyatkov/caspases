* Preparing databases and software
** Software

   Part information was obtained from this link [[   https://bioinf.shenwei.me/taxonkit/tutorial/#making-nr-blastdb-for-specific-taxids][link]]
   
   Main software which I used:
   - [[ https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/executables/blast+/LATEST/ncbi-blast-2.9.0+-x64-linux.tar.gz][NCBI BLAST]]
   - [[https://github.com/shenwei356/csvtk/releases/download/v0.18.2/csvtk_linux_amd64.tar.gz][CSVTK]]
   - [[https://github.com/shenwei356/seqkit/releases/download/v0.10.2/seqkit_linux_amd64.tar.gz][SEQKIT]]
   - pigz was installed using apt
   - all soft have links in ~/bin

** Download and prepare NR database, obtain subset of Vertebrates
  - Download last NR (non-redundant) database (not in one FASTA file, because headers don't presented very well in FASTA)
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  wget -c 'https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/db/v5/nr_v5.*.tar.gz'
